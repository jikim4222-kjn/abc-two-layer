# abc-two-layer
Minimal two-layer arithmetic framework for a structural proof of the ABC inequality. Separates additive and multiplicative complexity via the interlayer gap Δ = log c − log rad(abc), showing that contraction and sparsity cannot coexist on an infinite set.

# Two-Layer Arithmetic and a Structural Proof of the ABC Inequality

This repository contains the official materials, notes, figures, and computational experiments accompanying the paper **“Two-Layer Arithmetic and a Structural Proof of the ABC Inequality.”**

The project develops a **minimal two-layer arithmetic framework** that separates additive and multiplicative complexity.  
The interlayer gap  
\[
\Delta = \log c - \log \mathrm{rad}(abc)
\]  
is treated as a dynamical quantity governed by **contraction** (two-layer dynamics) and **arithmetic sparsity** (rad-small triples).  
These two forces cannot coexist on an infinite set, making the **ABC inequality a structural necessity** rather than an analytic estimate.
